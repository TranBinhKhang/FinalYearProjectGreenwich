## How to start

* To start the project, type "npm i" to install all of the necessary libraries. Then type "npm start" to start the frontend and "node index.js" to start the backend

* It is important to remember that since the app is hosted locally, all of the API in the source code has to be manually changed to the URL shown in the Expo developer tools
